# Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchase

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a Decision Tree classifier that can predict customer purchases based on their demographic and behavioral data. Two types of Decision Tree criteria are used: Gini and Entropy. The results are compared to determine the best model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various demographic and behavioral attributes of customers and whether they purchased the product or service.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset. This includes visualizations such as histograms, count plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Dropping highly correlated columns
- Label encoding of categorical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Training and Evaluation
Two Decision Tree classifiers are trained using Gini and Entropy criteria. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Visualizations of the decision trees are also provided.

## Conclusion
The notebook demonstrates how to build and evaluate Decision Tree classifiers to predict customer purchases. The results of the models using Gini and Entropy criteria are compared to determine the best performing model.
